# Machine-Learning
My personal machine learning algorithms repository, implemented in C++. I will do my best to update it periodically. You are free to use the implementations wherever you want without permission. This comes without any warranties though!

## Pull requests
A repository as complex as this one, especially given the lack of time I have for thorough testing, is bound to have implementation errors. Please let me know if you spot any of them by submitting a relevant pull request. If there is a particular machine learning algorithm you'd like to see here, let me know by raising an issue.
